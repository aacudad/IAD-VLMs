# Reasoning-Enhanced Vision-Language Models for Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection

> TU Delft MSc thesis (2026) — Adnane Acudad. This repository is the reproducible code-and-data companion to the thesis. It is meant to be the **front door** for the next student who inherits this work.

This project teaches a vision-language model (VLM) not just to say *whether* an
industrial part is defective, but to **explain why** in natural language. We start
from a base VLM, fine-tune it on Gemini-2.5-Flash reasoning traces, and then improve
the *corpus* rather than the optimiser. Across the board this lifts balanced accuracy
on held-out anomaly benchmarks (DS-MVTec, VisA, Real-IAD) while producing
human-readable inspection reasoning. All headline numbers in this README were
**recomputed from the raw evaluation JSONs** shipped in `results/`, see
[`results/eval_ba_inventory.txt`](results/eval_ba_inventory.txt) and the provenance
docs linked below.

### 10 Sep 2026

- `results/iter2_pool_loss_measurement/`: per-item cross-entropy of SFT+GRPO ckpt-530 on the 6,000-item pool of the
  post-GRPO refinement run (kept 0.44 nats/token, corrected 1.47, rewritten 0.85; anomalous items give 67 % of the loss).
  Script `scripts/03_rollout_star/measure_iter2_pool_loss.py`. Thesis Figure 6.4, section 6.7 and Appendix H.
- `results/strict_ba.py`: balanced accuracy with every unparsed answer counted wrong (the thesis policy). `compute_ba.py`
  reads the harness counts, which leave unparsed items out; the two differ only where a file has unparsed answers.
- `configs/sft/sft_qwen25vl_7b_6k_unfrozen_lr1e-5.yaml` and `scripts/01_sft/run_sft_qwen25vl_7b_6k_unfrozen_lr1e-5.sh`:
  the 6K SFT with the vision encoder unfrozen at the frozen recipe's learning rate, run 10 Sep 2026 to close the
  learning-rate confound of Table 4.2. Results are added when the run finishes.
- `scripts/05_figures/thesis_figures_v2/f11_tsne_reward_path.py`: Figure 5.2, the type strings through the reward's own
  embedding path (search_query prefix, masked pooling), corpus strings plus illustrative variants.

### The method: Keep-Correct-Revise (KCR)

**KCR** is the corpus-curation loop that produces every headline model here. Roll out
k = 8 answers from the current policy on the training pool, then bucket each item:

1. **Keep** the traces the policy already gets right. They are on-policy and they are correct, so they need no teacher at all.
2. **Correct** the ones it gets wrong. A teacher (Gemini) rewrites the trace from the gold verdict.
3. **Revise** the ones that are right but weakly grounded. The verdict is correct, the reasoning is not really looking at the image, so the teacher revises it.

Then fine-tune the **base** model on the result. Not the policy that produced the
rollouts, the base model. That is the whole method. It needs no reward function, no
KL term and no rollout budget at training time.

> **Naming.** The paper calls this **KCR**. This repository calls it **Arm C**, because
> it is the third arm of a three-arm teacher-distillation ablation (A = keep only,
> B = keep + correct, C = keep + correct + revise = KCR). Every filename, dataset key
> and results directory uses `abc_C` / `arm_C` / `iter2`. They are the same thing.
> "Arm C" below is used only where one arm of the ablation is meant.

## 0. What changed on 2026-09-07 and 08

A line-by-line review pass on the thesis (33 items, all applied) and the repository brought level with it; the
itemised list is the last section of [`docs/CHANGELOG_2026-09-06.md`](docs/CHANGELOG_2026-09-06.md). The points that
change how the numbers should be read:

- **The SFT+GRPO headline files were scored under the GRPO training prompt**, not the supervised train prompt, despite
  their file names. Under the train prompt the same checkpoint scores 80.74 / 70.50 (HF) or 81.83 / 70.79 (vLLM). The
  thesis keeps 82.73 / 70.39 and states the prompt everywhere it is used; the files and the log evidence are in
  [`results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/NOTE.md`](results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/NOTE.md).
- **New references**: Gemini 3.5 to 3.8 Flash zero-shot under the same harness
  ([`results/gemini_flash_family_eval/`](results/gemini_flash_family_eval/)), LLaVA KCR on held-out Real-IAD (84.03,
  [`results/heldout_realiad_eval/README.md`](results/heldout_realiad_eval/README.md)), and a frozen-vision GRPO reference
  run ([`results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozenvision_run1/`](results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozenvision_run1/), thesis Appendix N).
- **Type reward**: similarity tables computed on the reward's own embedding path, and the t-SNE inputs for the final
  corpus ([`results/anomaly_type_analysis/final_corpus/`](results/anomaly_type_analysis/final_corpus/)). The old
  8,908-string file is superseded.
- **Figures**: Figure 6.9 and every appendix example figure redrawn by `f8_pairs.py` and `f9_appendix_examples.py`,
  Figure 6.7 as a heat map, Appendix H.1 regenerated (`scripts/05_figures/thesis_figures_v2/`).
- **Dataset card** on Hugging Face rewritten with the thesis splits mapped to files
  ([`docs/HF_DATASET_CARD.md`](docs/HF_DATASET_CARD.md)); interactive viewers under [`docs/interactive/`](docs/interactive/).
- History rewritten before going public (see the changelog); a full-history credential scan found nothing.

## 0b. What changed on 2026-09-06

The thesis was verified number by number against this workspace and the repository was brought level with it.
The full report is [`docs/verification/NUMBER_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`](docs/verification/NUMBER_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md)
and the itemised list of additions is [`docs/CHANGELOG_2026-09-06.md`](docs/CHANGELOG_2026-09-06.md). In short: the LLaVA
KCR row is now the corrected corpus (87.32 / 72.65, 74.29 VisA at epoch 4) with the first build kept on record, every
eval file the thesis cites is under `results/`, the two rollout pools and the LLaVA corpora are under `traces/`, the
Chapter 6 figure pipeline is under `scripts/05_figures/thesis_figures_v2/`, and `NUMBER_PROVENANCE.md` no longer
claims authority over the thesis where the two disagreed (the baseline file and the patched-pool counts).

## 1. Headline results

**Balanced accuracy (BA)** on the two primary benchmarks, defined as
`BA = 0.5 * (TP/(TP+FN) + TN/(TN+FP))` and computed straight from the `metrics`
block (`tp, tn, fp, fn`) of each eval JSON. Recompute any cell with
[`results/compute_ba.py`](results/compute_ba.py); the full inventory of every
checkpoint we ever evaluated is in [`results/eval_ba_inventory.txt`](results/eval_ba_inventory.txt).

#### Cross-architecture, LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI

Same harness, same subsets, same recipe. This is IAD-R1's own headline backbone, so it
is the hardest place to argue that our result is a Qwen artefact.

Strict scoring, unparsed answers counted wrong. The June run of `gemini-3-flash-preview` (93.09 / 80.25) is kept in
[`results/gemini3flash_eval/`](results/gemini3flash_eval/) and is not in the thesis; see
[`docs/contamination_gemini3.md`](docs/contamination_gemini3.md).

#### Held-out Real-IAD (4,236 images never used for training)

| Model | BA | Source |
|---|---:|---|

#### Explanation quality (the point of the whole project)

Detection accuracy is only half of it. A Gemini-3-Flash judge scores the reasoning on
five axes (visual grounding, defect faithfulness, evidence before conclusion, coherence,
conciseness), 0 to 2 each, summed to 0 to 10. Median of three judge samples, n = 100
product-diverse traces per model per benchmark, each model scored on **its own** correctly
detected anomalies.

| Model | DS-MVTec /10 | VisA /10 |
|---|---:|---:|
| **KCR / Arm-C SFT** | **9.09** | **9.11** |
| Qwen SFT 6K / SFT+GRPO | 9.17 / 9.33 | 8.70 / 9.23 |
| Qwen3-VL-8B on the Qwen KCR corpus | 9.41 | 9.53 |
| LLaVA SFT / SFT+GRPO / KCR (corrected) | 9.36 / 9.47 / 9.61 | 8.57 / 9.43 / 9.34 |
| IAD-R1, asked the same way (prompt-matched) | 6.13 | 6.96 |
| IAD-R1, under its own prompt | 4.36 | 6.49 |

These are the shared-set numbers of the thesis (2026-09-06): every row scored on the same 90 DS-MVTec and 47 VisA images that all nine rows detect correctly, so differences are paired (`results/explainability_shared/`). The earlier own-100 protocol (`results/explainability_multi/`, each model on its own correct detections) gave the same ordering and stays on record.

The two IAD-R1 rows answer different questions and both belong here. Its own GRPO prompt
never asks for reasoning, so about 35 to 40 percent of its answers are a bare "Yes" and
score 0. That is explanation *reliability*. The prompt-matched row asks it the same way we
ask our models, all of its answers then carry a trace, and that is explanation *quality*.
Quoting only 4.50 understates IAD-R1. Full method and per-axis breakdown in
[`results/explainability_multi/README.md`](results/explainability_multi/README.md).

Benchmark sizes: DS-MVTec full *n* = 1670, VisA full *n* = 2141, held-out Real-IAD
*n* = 4236. The GRPO Run-2 checkpoint matches KCR on DS-MVTec while generalizing to a
Real-IAD split it never saw during SFT or RL.

### The cross-architecture result, and its caveat

**This is the strongest thing in the repository.** On LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI the corrected KCR corpus
reaches **87.32 / 72.65** at the DS-MVTec-selected epoch and **74.29** on VisA by epoch 4, from supervised
fine-tuning alone. SFT plus GRPO on that same backbone reaches **87.66 / 72.38**. The supervised stage ties
reinforcement learning on DS-MVTec and leads on VisA on IAD-R1's own architecture, which is the same
ordering measured on Qwen2.5-VL-7B (82.80 / 72.07 against 82.73 / 70.39). So it is a property of the
method, not of one backbone. The 88.45 / 74.25 figure of the first LLaVA build is on record in
`results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_llava_iter1_C/` but rests on a corpus that leaked 2,484 GRPO-split images
(thesis Appendix M).

GRPO is not useless there. It lifts its own init (LLaVA 6K SFT epoch 1, 85.91 / 68.26) by
+1.75 DS-MVTec and +4.12 VisA, and on both backbones it is the stage that teaches localisation
(`results/thesis_figure_data/loc_hit.json`: among detected anomalies the SFT+GRPO checkpoint places the
`<location>` tag in a correct cell 82.4 / 55.9 % of the time on Qwen and 83.1 / 71.2 % on LLaVA, against
73.2 / 38.1 and 77.5 / 54.2 after SFT). It just does not raise the verdict beyond what a better corpus reaches.

The LLaVA KCR corpus is a **native** loop, not the Qwen corpus reused. The rollouts came
from a LLaVA policy and the teacher corrected and revised LLaVA's own failures. Only the
rollout sampler changed between the two backbones. Every judging, bucketing and correction
script is shared.

> **Contamination caveat, DS-MVTec only.** The LLaVA-OneVision training mixture
> (`lmms-lab/LLaVA-OneVision-Data`, config `vision_flan(filtered)`) contains **1,999 of 186,060 rows**
> whose id matches `MVTecAD` (counted over all 50 parquet shards, `results/contamination_llava_ov_data/`;
> the earlier 426 came from a truncated index). VisA matches **0**. Every DS-MVTec number for a
> LLaVA-derived model in this repo therefore carries a pretraining-exposure asterisk,
> including IAD-R1's released checkpoint. **VisA does not.** Read the VisA column as the
> clean one.

> **One comparison we do not make.** Our IAD-R1 reference row (81.92 / 71.34) is their
> released **Qwen2.5-VL-7B** checkpoint re-evaluated on our harness. We never re-evaluated
> their LLaVA-OneVision checkpoint on the full subsets. So "we beat IAD-R1 on its own
> backbone" is not a claim this repo supports. What it supports is that our pipeline on
> their backbone scores 87.32 / 72.65 (74.29 VisA at epoch 4) under the same harness that
> scores their released model 81.92 / 71.34.

### Corpus transfer to a newer backbone

The KCR corpus was curated with a Qwen2.5-VL-7B policy. On **Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct**, a
backbone it was never rolled out from, it still lifts the model from **78.68 / 64.45** to
**85.82 / 76.52**, so **+7.14 DS-MVTec and +12.07 VisA**. Same corpus file, same recipe as
the Qwen2.5 Arm-C run, only the model and the chat template change.

**There is no GRPO comparison on that backbone.** Nothing was RL-trained on Qwen3-VL-8B.
This line supports a corpus-transfer claim and nothing more. The corpus-versus-RL comparison
exists only on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and on LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI.

### How much of the gain is the reasoning?

The obvious control. Take the exact 6,000 images, strip every trace, keep only the yes/no
label, and train the same model with the same hyperparameters on the same checkpoint grid.
Labels-only peaks at **77.86 / 68.64**. KCR on the same images reaches **82.80 / 72.07**.
Stripping the reasoning supervision costs **-4.94 DS-MVTec and -3.43 VisA**. Fine-tuning on
our images alone does a lot of the work, and the reasoning supervision adds the rest.
Details in [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_6k_noreason/NOTE.md`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_6k_noreason/NOTE.md).

The **AnomalyThink** dataset now has a `llava_kcr/` folder holding the LLaVA arms of the KCR
loop: **A 8,998** (keep only), **B 9,124** (keep + correct) and **C 6,000** (keep + correct +
revise = KCR, 50/50 anomaly/normal). Arm C is the corpus behind the 88.45 / 74.25 model. The
Qwen arms stay in `teacher_ablation_abc/` and `iter2/`.

The dataset ships our reasoning traces only. The underlying Real-IAD images are not redistributed (obtain Real-IAD separately).

### Explore the reasoning (trace viewers)

Self-contained HTML viewers show, per model, EVERY DS-MVTec and VisA sample with the true defect region overlaid in red, alongside that model's own generated reasoning trace and verdict (correct/incorrect). Open any file directly in a browser (images embedded, nothing to fetch): [`docs/trace_viewers/index.html`](docs/trace_viewers/index.html) links one page per model per benchmark (e.g. `armC_dsmvtec.html`, `armC_visa.html`; base is DS-MVTec only). Regenerate with [`scripts/05_figures/build_trace_viewer.py`](scripts/05_figures/build_trace_viewer.py) (`--all` for every sample, `--per-bench N` for a diverse subset).

Run `ls -R` from the repo root to see the exact tree. The directories above are stable.

**Where the new results live.** Every run family added for the cross-architecture work follows
the same `results/<run>/checkpoint-X/eval_<bench>_full_<mode>.json` layout, and each folder has a
`NOTE.md` with the per-epoch confusion matrices and the caveats:

## 3. What is and is NOT included

**Included (everything needed to re-derive the work):**
- All **training and eval code** (`scripts/`), all **configs** (`configs/`), all **prompts** (`prompts/`).
- The complete **reasoning-trace datasets** (`traces/`) as plain-text LlamaFactory
  JSONs. Each record is `{"messages": [...], "images": [...]}`. The `images` entries
  are **absolute cluster paths** (`/bulk/aacudad/reasoning_traces/reasoning_traces_gen/data/...`)
  — they work as-is on the TU Delft cluster; on any other machine, re-download the
  images (see below) and remap the prefix with
  [`traces/rewrite_image_paths.py`](traces/rewrite_image_paths.py). The actual
  pixels are not shipped.
- All **evaluation results** (`results/`): per-checkpoint eval JSONs with confusion-matrix
  counts, `trainer_state.json` loss/metric curves, the BA inventory, and `compute_ba.py`.

**NOT included (re-downloadable or re-trainable):**
- **Model weights.** The large base/SFT/GRPO weights are not committed here, but the
  headline checkpoints for all three backbones are released on Hugging Face (see
  *Released on Hugging Face* in Section 1 above). Alternatively, download Qwen2.5-VL,
  LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI or Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and re-run SFT/GRPO with the shipped configs.
- **Source / overlay images.** Real-IAD, MVTec/DS-MVTec, and MMAD are all
  re-downloadable — use the `download_*.py` scripts in [`scripts/00_generate/`](scripts/00_generate/).
  After downloading, point the trace JSONs at your copy with
  `python traces/rewrite_image_paths.py --old-prefix /bulk/aacudad/reasoning_traces/reasoning_traces_gen/data --new-prefix <your-data-dir> traces/**/*.json`.
- **The laptop backup** and any large scratch artifacts.

## 4. The data corpus (AnomalyThink-15K)

The reasoning supervision is **~14,472 Gemini-2.5-Flash traces** (single-pass "C1-only"),
generated on Real-IAD parts (temp 1.0, target 120–200 words inside `<think>`, 3 images per
anomaly = original + overlay + reference, 1 image per normal). Quality control is **in-prompt
auto-reject rules plus JSON/Pydantic schema validation** — there is no second-reviewer model
and no rubric filter.

The corpus is partitioned into **three disjoint, stratified (product × normal/anomaly) splits**:

| Split | Size | Used for |
|---|---:|---|
| SFT | 6,000 | Supervised fine-tuning (the headline SFT model) |
| GRPO | 4,236 (2,118 anomaly + 2,118 normal) | RL training |
| Held-out Real-IAD | 4,236 | Generalization test set |

The **6K SFT split is a strict subset** of the 14,472, and both have the same mean trace
length (~141 words). So the empirical "**6K SFT beats 15K SFT**" result is a
**data-count / composition effect at fixed compute** — not a length, verbosity, or
quality-filtering effect. See [`docs/data_card.md`](docs/data_card.md) for the full
breakdown (products per split, generation settings, QC rules) and the
**Variety STaR** corpus (rollout Arm-C ckpt-376 → Gemini judge → correct/rewrite → SFT on a
6K stratified variety set), which the thesis lists as future work (F5) and does not report on.

### The KCR corpora

The 14,472 Gemini traces are the *starting* corpus. The headline models train on a KCR-curated
corpus built on top of them, one per backbone:

| Corpus | Size | Where |
|---|---:|---|
| Qwen KCR (Arm C), the 82.80 / 72.07 and 85.82 / 76.52 models | 6,000 (50/50) | [`traces/iter2/sft_iter2_train.json`](traces/iter2/sft_iter2_train.json), key `iad_sft_iter2` |
| Qwen Arm A (keep only) | 2,978 | [`traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_A_kept_balanced.json`](traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_A_kept_balanced.json) |
| Qwen Arm B (keep + correct) | 4,369 | [`traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_B_kept_corrected.json`](traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_B_kept_corrected.json) |
| LLaVA KCR (Arm C), corrected build, the 87.32 / 72.65 model | 6,000 (3,000 / 3,000 by verdict, all in the SFT split) | [`traces/llava_kcr/sft_llava_C_original_train.json`](traces/llava_kcr/sft_llava_C_original_train.json) |
| LLaVA KCR, first build, the 88.45 / 74.25 model (leaky, Appendix M) | 6,000 (45.0 % anomalous by verdict) | [`traces/llava_kcr/sft_llava_C_first_build_train.json`](traces/llava_kcr/sft_llava_C_first_build_train.json) |
| The GRPO training file itself | 4,236 | [`traces/grpo_split/grpo_train.json`](traces/grpo_split/grpo_train.json) (not the same traces as `anomalythink_15k/grpo_train.json`, see its README) |
| Rollout pools behind both loops | 10,236 x 8 each | [`traces/rollout_pools/`](traces/rollout_pools/) (gzipped) |
| Control corpora (verifier-filtered 6K, Balanced-192, labels-only) | 5,797 / 192 / 6,000 | [`traces/controls/`](traces/controls/) |

Arm A is balanced on the Real-IAD acquisition folder (1,489 NG / 1,489 OK); by the `<answer>` verdict it is
1,298 anomalous / 1,680 normal, because a kept rollout on an NG capture whose defect is not visible at C1
answers no. Arm C and both LLaVA builds are stated by verdict above. `traces/iter2/` holds two versions of the
Qwen Arm-C file (a location-spelling fix, 316 traces), see its README.

The **bucket counts** of the loop itself, before any balancing, now shipped in `traces/rollout_pools/`.
Qwen: 8,872 kept, 1,364 corrected, 2,406 rewritten (of the 10,236, 84.6 % of rollouts on the 6,000 SFT
images give the correct verdict and 90.8 % of those images have at least one correct rollout). LLaVA: out of
10,236 rollouts, 9,179 kept, 1,057 needing correction and 2,499 needing a rewrite locally, after which the
Gemini judge demoted a further 133 from keep to rewrite (2,513 rewrites in total, 9,045 judge-confirmed). The arm files above are **balanced, stratified subsets** of those buckets, which is
why Arm A is 2,978 and not 8,872. Both loops end at a 6,000-record 50/50 Arm C.

The ablation is what justifies the third step. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, best-epoch DS-MVTec goes
**A 79.01, B 80.75, C 82.80**. Keeping alone is worth something, adding teacher correction is
worth about 1.7 pp more, and adding the revise step is worth about 2 pp on top of that. Full
reasoning in [`CLAIMS_EVIDENCE.md`](CLAIMS_EVIDENCE.md) §1.6.

## 5. The prompt-mode contract

The evaluation prompt that produced a result is encoded in the **eval JSON filename suffix**,
never inferred from context. The modes are:

- `_trainprompt` is the exact instruction template the model was trained with. Headline numbers use this.
- `_grpoprompt` is the GRPO-time prompt.
- `_bareprompt` is a minimal, unconditioned prompt.
- `_iadr1native` is IAD-R1's own prompt, used only on IAD-R1's released checkpoint.
- `_yesnouser` appends "Answer with yes or no." to the user turn. It exists for base models that do not emit the `<think>` / `<answer>` schema. Without it the strict parser reads every sample as "no" and returns BA exactly 50.00, which is a parser artefact and not a measurement. The LLaVA-OV base row uses this mode.
- `_noreasonprompt` is the labels-only control's prompt, which asks for a bare verdict and nothing else. It is character-identical to that run's training prompt.

So `eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json` is "DS-MVTec, full set, train-prompt mode".
**Comparing across modes is only fair within the same suffix.** Full details and the
exact prompt strings are in [`docs/prompt_modes.md`](docs/prompt_modes.md).

One extra tail exists and it is **not** a prompt mode. A trailing `_vllm`, as in
`eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt_vllm.json`, records that the model was **served through vLLM**
instead of the HuggingFace generate path. The prompt is unchanged. LLaVA-OneVision needs it
because the HF path costs about 9 s per sample against 0.71 s for vLLM. On a probe the two
paths agreed on 99 percent of samples.

---

## 6. Quickstart and where to go next

**Environment** (captured under [`env/`](env/)):

```bash
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate llama_sft
# WORK_DIR is the workspace holding Training/, outputs/, hf_cache/ and LlamaFactory/.
# Every script added for the LLaVA / Qwen3 / audit lines defaults it to the parent of
# this repository, so set it only if your layout differs.
export WORK_DIR=$(cd .. && pwd)
export HF_HOME=$WORK_DIR/hf_cache
```

Training uses **LlamaFactory** (`llamafactory-cli train <config.yaml>`); the GRPO trainer is
derived from IAD-R1 / AnomalyR1. Gemini generation runs via Vertex
(`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) or the API (`GEMINI_API_KEYS` in `.env`).

Three backbones are trained with the same LlamaFactory path. Qwen2.5-VL-7B and Qwen3-VL-8B use
the HuggingFace generate path for evaluation. **LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI is served through vLLM for
evaluation and for KCR rollouts**, because its anyres image budget is about 3,700 image tokens
and the HF path costs about 9 s per sample against 0.71 s for vLLM. Those results carry a `_vllm`
tail on the filename, see section 5.

GRPO Run-2 (the headline RL config, read from the saved `training_args.bin`):
base/ref = 7B-frozen-6K SFT **ckpt-564**; `num_generations` G = **4**; KL coef `beta` = **0**
(KL is *monitored* via Schulman k3, not added to the loss); LR `eta` = **1e-6**; clip `epsilon`
= **0.2**; **4,236** training samples; max **1,060** steps (save/eval every 250); reward weights
`(w_f, w_a, w_t, w_l) = (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2)`; the reasoning reward (judge server :5100) is
**not used** → flat 0.5; type-embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` (server :5200);
per-device BS 2, grad-accum 4 (EBS 8); max prompt 2048 / completion 512; bf16; seed 42; 2× RTX A6000
with ZeRO-3 CPU offload.

## 7. SECURITY — read before pushing anything public

> **This repository is NOT yet safe to publish.** Live credentials are still embedded in
> some of the helper scripts and must be removed first.

At time of writing, **Hugging Face tokens** and the **Vertex service-account key** are still
present in some `download_*.py` scripts and in the judge servers under
[`scripts/02_grpo/`](scripts/02_grpo/) and [`scripts/00_generate/`](scripts/00_generate/).
**Before the first public commit you MUST:**

1. **Rotate** every credential — revoke the HF tokens and the Vertex service-account key,
   issue fresh ones, and load them only from environment variables / a git-ignored `.env`.
2. **Add a `.gitignore`** that excludes `.env`, `*.json` service-account keys, `hf_cache/`,
   model weights, and any local image data.
3. **Scan with [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)** (`gitleaks detect --source .`)
   and confirm zero findings — including the full git **history**, not just the working tree.

Do not push to a public remote until all three are done and verified.

**Status note, 2026-09-02.** Step 2 is done. `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `*key*.json`,
`vertexai-*.json`, `*.pem`, `hf_cache/`, weights and local image data, and `.env` is present on
disk but untracked. A pattern scan over all **tracked** files today found no live credential.
The only hits are the two documented placeholders (`.env.example` and `RUNBOOK.md`) and, in
`docs/trace_viewers/*.html`, a handful of `AIza...` strings that are random substrings inside
base64-encoded images, not API keys. They are 34 and 45 characters long, and a Google API key is
exactly 39. Expect a naive secret scanner to flag them.

**Steps 1 and 3 are still open.** Nobody has confirmed the credentials were rotated, and nobody
has run gitleaks over the full **history**, which is what actually matters once a repo is public.
Do that before treating this warning as cleared.
