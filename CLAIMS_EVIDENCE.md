# CLAIMS_EVIDENCE.md — Provenance for every claim in the thesis

**Thesis:** *Reasoning-Enhanced Vision-Language Models for Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection* — Adnane Acudad, TU Delft MSc, 2026 (backbone: Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B).

## Purpose

This document supports **every claim made in the thesis** by recording (a) how the claim was reached, (b) the exact experiment or procedure that answered the underlying question, and (c) the on-disk evidence file that backs it. The motivating question is the simple reproducibility test: *"if the text mentions 6K, how did we get to 6K?"* — and likewise for every number, design choice, and qualitative finding.

It is organised in two layers:

1. **Key design decisions — how we got here.** A narrative for each major fork in the project (the 6K SFT split, C1-only traces, frozen vs unfrozen ViT, the four-component GRPO reward, `G=4 / β=0 / η=1e-6`, the teacher-ablation Arms A/B/C, the STaR rollout→judge→correct/rewrite→SFT loop, and the Real-IAD-Variety extension). Each subsection states the question, the procedure that answered it, the evidence, and the conclusion — concrete enough for the next student to re-run the reasoning.
2. **Per-chapter claim tables.** One table per chapter, preserving every extracted claim, with columns *Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status*.

### How to recompute the headline numbers

All balanced-accuracy (BA) figures in this repo are recomputable from the shipped eval JSONs. The metric is

```
BA = 0.5 * ( TP/(TP+FN) + TN/(TN+FP) )    # from the JSON "metrics" block {tp,tn,fp,fn}
```

Use [`results/compute_ba.py`](results/compute_ba.py) on any `results/<run>/checkpoint-X/eval_<bench>_full_<mode>.json`. A full pre-computed listing lives in [`results/eval_ba_inventory.txt`](results/eval_ba_inventory.txt). Spot-checks done this session (all exact):

| Model | File | BA |
|---|---|---|
| 7B-frozen-6K SFT ckpt-564 (headline SFT) | [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json) | DS 80.16 (TP988 TN354 FP90 FN238) |
| GRPO Run-2 ckpt-530 (headline RL) | [`results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/checkpoint-530/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/checkpoint-530/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json) | DS 82.73 (TP971 TN383 FP61 FN255) |
| Arm-C SFT ckpt-376 (single best detector) | [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_abc_C_full_patched/checkpoint-376/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_abc_C_full_patched/checkpoint-376/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json) | DS 82.80 (TP1003 TN372 FP72 FN223) |

> **Note on paths.** The original training tree used `outputs/<run>/…`. The shipped repo mirrors those eval JSONs under [`results/<run>/…`](results/). Where a claim cites an `outputs/…` path that is not shipped (rotated-away checkpoints, probe CSVs, training logs), the *Evidence* column says so and the status reflects that it cannot be reproduced from the public repo alone.

### Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **supported** | Claim reproduces exactly (or within rounding) from a shipped/verified artefact, or is a sound restatement of cited literature. |
| **partially-supported** | The direction/core of the claim holds, but a magnitude, attribution, or sub-claim is loose, off by a small margin, or rests on an unlogged estimate. |
| **unverified** | No on-disk artefact confirms it, **or** the on-disk artefact *contradicts* it (e.g. an anecdotal hyperparameter, a fabricated appendix table). Read the *How it was derived* cell — "unverified" here often means "actively wrong per the data," not merely "unchecked." |

# Part 0 — Post-thesis claims (added 2026-09-02)

These claims are **not** in the submitted thesis PDF. They come from runs finished after submission
and they are the claims the README and the conference paper lean on. Same columns and same status
legend as the per-chapter tables in Part 2.

Throughout: the method is **Keep-Correct-Revise (KCR)**. Keep the rollouts the policy already gets
right, have a teacher correct the wrong ones and revise the ones that are right but weakly grounded,
then fine-tune the base model on the result. "Arm C" is the same thing under its ablation name (A =
keep only, B = keep + correct, C = keep + correct + revise = KCR) and it is what every path, dataset
key and results directory below uses.

## 0.1 Explanation quality (the number that changed)

| Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KCR/Arm-C explanations score **9.05** on DS-MVTec and **8.52** on VisA, against **6.14** and **7.04** for IAD-R1 asked the same way. | README §1, conference paper explanation table | Gemini-3-Flash judge shown image + red GT-mask overlay + GT defect type + the model's trace. 5 axes scored 0/1/2, summed 0–10. **Median of 3 judge samples.** n=100 product-diverse traces per model per benchmark. Each model scored **on its own correctly-detected anomalies** (`gt=yes & pred=yes`). | [`results/explainability_multi/explainability_5axes_table.md`](results/explainability_multi/explainability_5axes_table.md), `summary.json`, `raw_results.json`, `raw_results_iadr1_tp.json`; script [`scripts/04_eval/explainability_judge_multi.py`](scripts/04_eval/explainability_judge_multi.py) | supported |
| The **older** 9.14 vs 4.29 (DS-MVTec) / 8.67 vs 6.40 (VisA) figures are superseded, not wrong-in-kind. | [`NUMBER_PROVENANCE.md`](NUMBER_PROVENANCE.md) 2026-09-02 entry, and the flagged 2026-06-16 entry | Old run scored IAD-R1 **under its own GRPO prompt**, which never asks for reasoning. About 35–40% of its answers are a bare "Yes" and score 0 on every axis. That measures explanation *reliability* under its own prompt, not explanation *quality*. It was also k=1, a single judge sample. | `outputs/explainability_judge/EXPLAINABILITY_EVAL.md` (source tree, not shipped); superseded row kept verbatim in `NUMBER_PROVENANCE.md` | supported |
| The prompt-matched row is the fair comparison for **reasoning quality**. | `results/explainability_multi/README.md` | Asked the same way as our models, 100% of IAD-R1's answers carry a trace, so the two models are scored on the same task. k=3 median damps judge noise. Per-model own-correct-detections design avoids penalising a model through a shrinking cross-model intersection. | [`results/explainability_multi/README.md`](results/explainability_multi/README.md) "The two IAD-R1 rows" section | supported |
| Both IAD-R1 rows should survive any rewrite, because they answer different questions. | same | Native prompt 4.50 / 6.32 = reliability. Prompt-matched 6.14 / 7.04 = quality. Quoting only 4.50 understates IAD-R1. Either way it stays clearly below KCR. | same table | supported |

## 0.2 Cross-architecture replication on LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI

| Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| On LLaVA-OneVision-7B-SI the KCR corpus reaches **88.45 / 74.25**, above **87.66 / 72.58** for SFT+GRPO on the same backbone. | README §1 headline table, conference paper | Both trained and evaluated on the identical harness and subsets (DS-MVTec n=1670, VisA n=2141), `_trainprompt` mode, vLLM serving. BA recomputed from the `tp/tn/fp/fn` block with `results/compute_ba.py`. | KCR: [`results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_llava_iter1_C/checkpoint-748/`](results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_llava_iter1_C/checkpoint-748/) (DS tp1045 tn407 fp37 fn181; VisA tp942 tn659 fp285 fn255). GRPO: [`results/grpo_llava_ov_from_ep1/checkpoint-530/`](results/grpo_llava_ov_from_ep1/checkpoint-530/) (DS tp1078 tn388 fp56 fn148; VisA tp958 tn611 fp330 fn236) | supported |
| The KCR loop is backbone-agnostic. Only the rollout sampler changed. | README §1, `docs/` KCR loop note | The LLaVA post-rollout pipeline reuses the already-shipped `phase0_bucket.py`, `phase1a_gemini_judge.py` and `phase1b_gemini_correct.py` unchanged. Only the rollout front-end and the arm builder are new. | [`scripts/03_rollout_star/`](scripts/03_rollout_star/) | supported |
| The LLaVA KCR corpus is a **native** loop, not a Qwen corpus reused. | README §1 | Rollouts came from a LLaVA policy, the teacher corrected and revised LLaVA's own failures. Arms A 8,998 / B 9,124 / C 6,000, C at 50/50. | `Training/datasets_sft_llava_iter1/` (source tree); published as `llava_kcr/` in [`aacudad/AnomalyThink`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aacudad/AnomalyThink) | supported |
| GRPO does work on this backbone. It just does not reach the corpus. | README §1 | GRPO init is LLaVA 6K SFT ep1 (85.91 / 68.26). ckpt-530 is 87.66 / 72.58, so +1.75 / +4.32 over its own init. | [`results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_iad_sft_6k_train/checkpoint-188/`](results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_iad_sft_6k_train/checkpoint-188/) and [`results/grpo_llava_ov_from_ep1/checkpoint-530/`](results/grpo_llava_ov_from_ep1/checkpoint-530/) | supported |
| **Contamination caveat.** DS-MVTec numbers for LLaVA-derived models carry a pretraining-exposure asterisk. VisA does not. | README §1, every LLaVA `NOTE.md` | `lmms-lab/LLaVA-OneVision-Data`, config `vision_flan(filtered)`, contains **426 rows** whose id matches `%MVTecAD%`. VisA matches **0**. Applies to IAD-R1's released model as well. | Verified live through the Hugging Face datasets-server filter; recorded in `NUMBER_PROVENANCE.md` 2026-09-02 entry and [`results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_llava_iter1_C/NOTE.md`](results/sft_llava_ov_7b_frozen_llava_iter1_C/NOTE.md) | supported |
| **Do NOT claim** "beats IAD-R1 on its own backbone" against the 81.92 / 71.34 row. | — | That row is IAD-R1's released **Qwen2.5-VL-7B** checkpoint re-evaluated on our harness. We never re-evaluated their LLaVA-OneVision checkpoint on the full subsets. The comparison is same-harness, not same-backbone. | [`results/iad_r1_qwen_recanon/`](results/iad_r1_qwen_recanon/); see also §2.5.3 row in Part 2 | unverified (as a same-backbone claim) |

## 0.3 Corpus transfer to Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct

| Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The KCR corpus transfers to a newer, stronger backbone: **78.68 / 64.45 → 85.82 / 76.52** (+7.14 / +12.07). | README §1 | `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` from base, 4 epochs, frozen vision tower, config mirrors `sft_abc_C.yaml` except model, `template: qwen3_vl`, output dir and batch.

## 0.4 Labels-only control (how much of the gain is the reasoning?)

| Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

# Part 1 — Key design decisions: how we got here

Each subsection answers: *what was the open question, what experiment/procedure resolved it, which file proves it, and what did we conclude.*

## 1.1 Why 6,000 SFT traces (and not the full ~14,500)?

**The question.** The corpus has ~14,472 traces. Should we train SFT on all of them, or on the smaller 6,000-trace stratified split? The naive "more data is always better" heuristic says use everything.

**The procedure.** Run the *same* 7B-frozen SFT recipe on (a) the 6,000-trace SFT split and (b) the full ~14,472-trace union ("15K"), at a matched 3-epoch operating point, then compare DS-MVTec BA. Crucially, the 6K split is a **100% subset** of the 14,472 union, and both have the **same mean `<think>` length (~141 words, ≈137 recompute)** — so any difference cannot be a verbosity/length effect, and (because QC is in-prompt only, with no second-pass scoring filter) it is not a quality-ranking filter either.

**The evidence.**
- 6K ckpt-564: DS **80.16** — [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json)
- 15K ckpt-1359 (ep3): DS **71.66** — [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_15k_frozen/checkpoint-1359/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_15k_frozen/checkpoint-1359/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json) (inventory lists 71.66 at this ckpt)
- Subset/equal-length facts: 6K = 100% subset of [`traces/anomalythink_15k/combined_sft_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_15k/combined_sft_train.json); equal mean `<think>` words (recompute).

**The conclusion.** 6K beats 15K by **~8.5 pp** at fixed compute. Because 6K is a same-length subset, the effect is **data-count / composition at fixed compute** — at a fixed epoch budget the 15K config is under-trained (2.41× more updates needed for equal epochs), and the extra ~8.5K traces (which are the GRPO + held-out splits, same generation recipe) add no benefit and slightly hurt. The 6,000-trace split is therefore the headline SFT corpus.

> **Caveat the next student must know.** The 8.5 pp gap holds against the **ep3 ckpt-1359** 15K number (71.66). The thesis discussion chapter at one point compares against a *corrected* later-epoch 15K value (~80.12) where the gap collapses to ~0 — that comparison is flagged **unverified** below (sec:disc-quality). The headline 8.5 pp claim is the ep3-vs-ep3 comparison. Also note the introduction mislabels this as "concise vs verbose," which is **wrong** (same length) — recorded as partially-supported.

## 1.2 Why C1-only traces?

**The question.** Real-IAD ships five camera angles per product. Should the trace corpus mix all five views or restrict to one?

**The procedure.** For one of the two main SFT runs, restrict generation to the **C1 camera angle** to reduce distribution variability; a C1-only-vs-all-5 ablation is set up in the SFT chapter. The C1-only variant is materialised on disk.

**The evidence.** [`traces/anomalythink_15k/c1_only_fixed/new_sft_c1_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_15k/c1_only_fixed/new_sft_c1_train.json) (4,236) and [`traces/anomalythink_15k/c1_only_fixed/combined_sft_c1_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_15k/c1_only_fixed/combined_sft_c1_train.json) (10,236) exist as the C1-restricted variants. The whole AnomalyThink-15K corpus is in fact C1-only per ground truth.

**The conclusion.** C1-only reduces nuisance variability (lighting/pose across the five views) so the model spends capacity on defect signal, not viewpoint. The headline corpora are C1-only.

> Watch out: `new_sft_c1_train.json` (n=4,236, mean `<think>` ≈417 words) is a **much longer rewritten variant** belonging to a different (variety/iter-2) generation, NOT the headline SFT corpus — do not confuse it with the 6K SFT pool.

## 1.3 Why freeze the vision encoder (ViT)?

**The question.** During SFT, should we fine-tune the ViT (unfrozen) or hold it fixed (frozen, training only the LM trunk + multimodal projector)?

**The procedure.** Four-factor SFT grid (size 3B/7B × frozen/unfrozen × 6K/15K × epoch) with **frozen vs unfrozen** as one axis. Compare matched cells, paying special attention to the harder VisA benchmark and to per-class recall.

**The evidence.**
- 7B-frozen-6K VisA recall 71.1% vs 7B-unfrozen-15K VisA recall 34.8–40.6% (recall = tp/(tp+fn) from VisA JSONs): [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_visa_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_visa_full_trainprompt.json) vs `results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_15k_unfrozen/checkpoint-*/eval_visa_full_trainprompt.json` (inventory: unfrozen VisA BA 57.13–59.18 vs frozen 64.28–66.94).
- Config that defines "frozen": [`configs/sft/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen.yaml`](configs/sft/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen.yaml) — `freeze_vision_tower: true`, `freeze_multi_modal_projector: false`, `freeze_language_model: false`.

**The conclusion.** Frozen wins consistently, most visibly on VisA (the unfrozen model collapses on VisA defect recall). Mechanism: the per-token SFT loss is dominated by language tokens, so the ViT receives only an indirect gradient through the connector and overfits/destabilises on small data — consistent with OpenVLThinker. Frozen is the headline setting.

> Caveat: the *DS-MVTec* magnitude of the frozen advantage is small once the cross-contaminated 15K-unfrozen rows are corrected (corrected 7B-Frozen-15K DS 68.65 vs 7B-Unfrozen-15K DS 68.58). The robust, large gap is on **VisA recall**, not DS BA. Also: the **6K-unfrozen** cells (3B and 7B) were **never run** — those table rows duplicate 15K-unfrozen data, so the "effect of freezing at 6K" is not backed by a real run.

## 1.4 The four-component GRPO reward (and why the reasoning reward is a flat 0.5)

**The question.** What reward should drive GRPO for explainable IAD, given that a bare binary-verdict reward is too sparse?

**The procedure.** Decompose the reward into four bounded-in-[0,1] components summed to max 1.0 with weights **(format 0.3, accuracy 0.3, type 0.2, location 0.2)**:
- **Format (0.3):** label-conditioned regexes — anomalous samples earn partial credit per required tag (`+0.075/tag`); normal samples are penalised (`-0.1`) for forbidden `<type>`/`<location>`. Catches free-form prose and spurious `<type>None</type>`.
- **Accuracy (0.3):** binary verdict match.
- **Type (0.2):** graded semantic similarity (exact 1.0 / substring 0.8 / else cosine) via **nomic-embed-text-v2-moe** on CPU (server :5200); only when gold is anomalous and both emit `<type>`. Binary equality is too sparse for synonyms (Scratch/Surface scratch/Abrasion).
- **Location (0.2):** high-recall **presence** reward (0.2 for any `<location>` value) — deliberately **not** IAD-R1's 3×3 grid match, which a pilot found brittle to paraphrase ("top-right" vs "upper right corner").

The **reasoning reward** (a Gemini-judge server on :5100) was implemented but **not used** in the production run — it is emitted as a flat 0.5, i.e. "no reasoning reward." GRPO is thus *Gemini-judge-free*; all four live rewards are local.

**The evidence.** Reward weights and the unused judge: ground-truth `training_args.bin` and reward source ([`scripts/02_grpo/stage_rl/reward.py`](scripts/02_grpo/stage_rl/reward.py), `reward_process/`); type-embed server [`scripts/02_grpo/gemini_judge_server_v2.py`](scripts/02_grpo/gemini_judge_server_v2.py) loads `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` float32. Arithmetic 0.3+0.3+0.2+0.2 = 1.0.

**The conclusion.** Format + accuracy (0.6 combined) are the non-negotiable structure + headline verdict; type/location (0.2 each) are auxiliary signals that cannot flip a correct verdict. All bounded so the group-normalised advantage is dimensionless. The reasoning reward was dropped to keep the run judge-free and reproducible.

## 1.5 Why G=4, β=0, η=1e-6?

**The question.** What GRPO hyperparameters keep the policy stable on a 7B VLM under a 2×A6000 budget?

**The procedure / evidence (all from saved run-2 `training_args.bin`).**
- **G=4 (num_generations).** Larger G lowers advantage variance (DeepSeekMath uses G=64), but each rollout on a 7B VLM under ZeRO-3 CPU offload is ~30 s; the run log shows **83.85 s/step** for G=4. G=4 is the largest group that keeps per-step cost within budget.
- **β=0 (KL coefficient).** KL is **monitored** via Schulman's unbiased **k3** estimator but **not added to the loss** — `trainer_state.json` logs `kl` as a separate metric and the loss is ~0. Over the 2-epoch budget the monitored KL stayed bounded (min 0.0, max 0.117), so the policy never drifted dangerously.
- **η=1e-6 (learning rate).** GRPO is far more LR-sensitive than SFT; at 1e-6 KL stays small while combined reward climbs monotonically (1.66→2.13). No high-LR ablation JSON is on disk, so the "higher LR drifts" half is design rationale, not a logged experiment.

Files: saved `training_args.bin`; [`results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/checkpoint-530/trainer_state.json`](results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/checkpoint-530/trainer_state.json); [`scripts/02_grpo/run_grpo_7b_resume_run2.sh`](scripts/02_grpo/run_grpo_7b_resume_run2.sh).

**The conclusion.** `G=4 / β=0 / η=1e-6 / ε=0.2`, 2 epochs over 4,236 prompts (max 1,060 steps), is a deliberately *minimal* recipe — and it still beats SFT-Iter1. Neither iter-2 nor G2RPO beats it.

## 1.6 The teacher ablation: Arms A / B / C, and why C

**The question.** Holding the 6,000-image pool fixed, how much does each *layer* of teacher (Gemini) intervention improve the SFT corpus?

**The procedure.** Three corpora that vary only the teacher intervention ladder, each trained from base with frozen ViT, best epoch selected on DS-MVTec:
- **Arm A** — self-distillation only, **no Gemini**: 2,978 model-written items ([`traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_A_kept_balanced.json`](traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_A_kept_balanced.json), len 2,978).
- **Arm B** — A + Gemini-corrected NG traces (rationalisation-on-failure / STaR): 4,369 items ([`traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_B_kept_corrected.json`](traces/teacher_ablation_abc/sft_B_kept_corrected.json), len 4,369).
- **Arm C** — STaR + Saunders critique-and-revise: 6,000 items (50/50), the richest intervention.

**The evidence.** Best-epoch DS-MVTec: A 79.01, B 80.75, **C 82.80** ([`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_abc_C_full_patched/checkpoint-376/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_abc_C_full_patched/checkpoint-376/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json), recompute 82.80 / VisA [`…/eval_visa_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_abc_C_full_patched/checkpoint-376/eval_visa_full_trainprompt.json) 72.07). VisA ordering is **C > A > B** (72.07 > 70.21 > 68.73) — Arm B's extra Gemini-corrected NG traces *hurt* VisA.

**The conclusion (finding O3).** On DS-MVTec **C > B > A**, each layer of Gemini intervention buying ~2 pp. **Arm C SFT alone (82.80/72.07) is the single best detector in the thesis** — it matches the SFT+GRPO model on DS (within 0.07) and beats it on VisA (+1.68), and beats the re-canonicalised IAD-R1 baseline (81.92/71.34) on **both** subsets (+0.88 DS / +0.73 VisA) **using SFT alone**. Arm C ckpt-376 is also the iter-2 / GRPO-on-C base.

## 1.7 The STaR loop: rollout → judge → correct/rewrite → SFT

**The question.** Can the model improve itself by learning from its own rollouts, corrected by the teacher (the STaR / critique-and-revise recipe that produced Arm C, and the iter-2 self-distillation loop)?

**The procedure.**
- **Teacher-ablation (Arm C) form:** roll out, keep correct self-traces (RAFT-style rejection sampling), and have Gemini *rationalise-on-failure* (STaR) and *critique-and-revise* (Saunders) the rest, then SFT from base.
- **Iter-2 form:** roll out from GRPO ckpt-530, **reject-sample** (verdict matches gold AND XML passes the format regex) → 4,026 self-traces, **reset to 7B base**, fresh SFT (frozen ViT, η=1e-5, batch 4, 4 epochs), then GRPO again. Two filter variants: v1 (first pass) and v2 (stricter format match + de-duplication).

**The evidence.** Filtered self-trace count: [`traces/iter2/iter2_v2_sft_train.json`](traces/iter2/iter2_v2_sft_train.json) len **4,026**. Iter-2 GRPO best DS = **80.64** ([`results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_iter2_v2_full/checkpoint-530/eval_dsmvtec_full_grpoprompt.json`](results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_iter2_v2_full/checkpoint-530/eval_dsmvtec_full_grpoprompt.json)) < single-stage **82.73**.

**The conclusion.** The Arm-C critique-and-revise loop is the *best* corpus (82.80). But the *iter-2* SFT↔RL loop **does not beat single-stage GRPO** on the narrow IAD task (80.64 < 82.73): the rollout/filter concentrates on easy examples, and a later balanced-pool refinement collapsed by catastrophic forgetting (322/1670 unparsable at ep1). Single-stage is retained as the strongest GRPO checkpoint; remedy proposed = difficulty-aware filter + mix-in of original Gemini traces.

## 1.8 The Real-IAD-Variety extension (in progress — thesis placeholder)

**The question.** Does the exact Arm-C STaR recipe scale from 30 Real-IAD products to the 160-category Real-IAD-Variety view?

**The procedure.** Roll out the Arm-C 82.80 checkpoint at k=8 over the 160-category C1 view → Gemini judge → correct/rewrite → assemble a 6,000-trace SFT corpus stratified by product × normal/anomaly (**3,000 OK / 3,000 NG, 160 products**).

**The evidence.** [`traces/variety_star_6k/variety_star_sft_6k.json`](traces/variety_star_6k/variety_star_sft_6k.json) exists with **6,000** traces, 160 distinct products, exactly 3,000/3,000. **Eval results are explicitly a placeholder** — the `phase0_variety_star` rollout dirs are empty on disk.

**The conclusion.** Pipeline and corpus exist and match the Variety-STaR description; numeric results are deferred (future work F5). Any Variety performance claim in the thesis is a placeholder, not a measured result.

## Chapter 03 — Reasoning Trace Generation (AnomalyThink corpus)

| Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AnomalyThink = ~14.5K Gemini traces over Real-IAD, 3 disjoint stratified splits (6K/4K/4K). | L5, L150–156, L168 | json `len`: union 14,472; GRPO 4,236; held-out 4,236; SFT 6,000. | [`traces/anomalythink_15k/combined_sft_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_15k/combined_sft_train.json); [`traces/anomalythink_6k/combined_6k_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_6k/combined_6k_train.json) | supported |
| Splits enforce 50/50 balance, per-product stratification, zero image overlap. | L150–156, L170 | `<answer>` counts: 6K 3000/3000; GRPO 2118/2118; union ~50%. Overlap/stratification consistent with design, not re-tested. | json answer-tag counts. | partially-supported |
| 6K is a stratified PARTITION, not a quality-ranked subset; no second reviewer, no numeric score. | L138, L144, L225, L236 | `generate_realiad_traces.py` loads `inspector_prompt.txt` (no rubric) + Pydantic only; 6K = SFT partition. | [`scripts/00_generate/generate_realiad_traces.py`](scripts/00_generate/generate_realiad_traces.py) | supported |
| QC is in-prompt; 6K-beats-15K is composition/epoch-efficiency, not a filter. | L138, L144 | In-prompt self-check + schema gate; 6K is subset, equal mean length. | gen pipeline; cross-ref Ch.06. | supported |
| Four-tag XML schema identical to IAD-R1's, adopted unchanged for comparability; contribution is content/data/config. | L58, L221–233 | Schema {think,location,type,answer} matches SC-GRPO; trainer derived from IAD-R1/AnomalyR1. | li2025iadr1; ground truth. | supported |

| The exact "six-phase template" prompt + five worded auto-reject rules are not recoverable from on-disk gen code; production prompt differs. | L60–68, L123–130 | `generate_realiad_traces.py` loads `inspector_prompt.txt` (3–5 sentence, allows bare locations, ~18 types, no auto-reject, even a mask-leak hint). `inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt` (NOT loaded) has 6 auto-reject + 8-dim rubric. Neither matches thesis wording, yet corpus matches description → production prompt differed from both. | [`prompts/inspector_prompt.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt.txt); [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt) | partially-supported |

## Appendix B — Reproduced Prompts

| Claim | Where | How it was derived | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Appendix reproduces the verbatim Gemini trace-generation system prompt actually used. | intro L5; §app:p-gemini L8 | Gen scripts load `inspector_prompt.txt`; `generate_variety_traces.py` loads `inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`. Appendix text (six-phase, 120–200 words, 5 auto-reject, 26 types, 9 cells) matches `_test_v2` (the Variety/in-progress prompt), NOT the `inspector_prompt.txt` that produced the headline 15K corpus. | [`prompts/inspector_prompt.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt.txt); [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt); [`scripts/00_generate/generate_realiad_traces.py`](scripts/00_generate/generate_realiad_traces.py) | partially-supported |
| The prompt enforces a SIX-PHASE template (FRAMING/SCAN/FOCUS/EVALUATE/ALTERNATIVES/DECIDE) in `<think>`. | Gemini prompt L25–36 | `_test_v2` (L201–225) has a 6-step A–F flow mapping 1:1, but is not labelled "SIX-PHASE"/numbered; eval system prompt has no six-phase wording. The label is a thesis paraphrase/idealisation. | [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt); [`scripts/04_eval/`](scripts/04_eval/) eval prompt. | partially-supported |
| QC is purely in-prompt auto-reject (no second model, no rubric). | Gemini prompt L65–71; intro | Matches stated QC design (5 auto-reject bullets, no rubric shown). BUT `inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt` itself embeds an 8-category 0/1/2 SCORING rubric + 13/16 PASS/FAIL + REWRITE POLICY (L349–463) which the appendix omits — a redacted view of the source. | [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt) L349–446. | partially-supported |
| Auto-reject rules forbid overlay/label/GT/mask leakage, ordinal/other-image refs, premature naming, definitive causality. | Gemini prompt L65–71 | Each appendix bullet maps onto a `_test_v2` source rule (A–F, L54–109, L404–426). | [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt) L54–109, L404–426. | supported |
| Generation inputs: original photo, optional red overlay (auxiliary, never named), optional defect-free reference. | Gemini prompt L16–23 | Matches ground truth (3-image anomaly / 1 normal) and `_test_v2` L16–24, L146–177. | [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt) L16–24, L146–177. | supported |
| A single inference system prompt served SFT, GRPO and eval (two-image ref-vs-test). | §app:p-inf L78, L81–98 | Actual prompts differ: eval is single-image ("Inspect the provided image"); GRPO is two-image with different wording; neither says "six-phase". Output-tag contract IS consistent. Appendix is an idealised composite. | [`scripts/04_eval/`](scripts/04_eval/) eval prompt; [`scripts/02_grpo/stage_rl/grpo_ad.py`](scripts/02_grpo/stage_rl/grpo_ad.py) L113–136. | partially-supported |
| Inference prompt instructs "same controlled vocabularies as training" + six-phase template. | Inference prompt L90, L97 | Actual eval prompt has neither phrase, only loose examples ("e.g., scratch, dent..."); GRPO prompt has no six-phase. Idealisation. | [`scripts/04_eval/`](scripts/04_eval/) L57–66; [`scripts/02_grpo/stage_rl/grpo_ad.py`](scripts/02_grpo/stage_rl/grpo_ad.py) L93–136. | partially-supported |
| The 120–200 word think budget shaped the realized corpus. | Gemini prompt L42,48,74 | sft_train (n=10,236) mean think-words 136.9 / median 137 → matches ~141 mean, just under target; ~55.6% strictly in 120–200, long tail (max 763). `new_sft_c1_train.json` (n=4,236, mean 416.8) clearly does NOT obey the budget → a different generation. | [`traces/anomalythink_15k/sft_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_15k/sft_train.json); [`traces/anomalythink_15k/c1_only_fixed/new_sft_c1_train.json`](traces/anomalythink_15k/c1_only_fixed/new_sft_c1_train.json) | supported |
| Both prompts share the output schema: JSON {image_id, reasoning} for gen; `<think>/<answer>`(+`<type>/<location>` if anomalous) for inference. | Gemini prompt L38–49; Inference L89–96 | `_test_v2` L228–250 + eval `extract_tags()` parse think/type/location/answer; anomalous-only type/loc conditioning matches. | [`prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt`](prompts/inspector_prompt_test_v2.txt) L228–250; [`scripts/04_eval/`](scripts/04_eval/) extract_tags. | supported |

## Appendix C — Per-Product Breakdown (largely fabricated; flagged)

> **Audit verdict.** Base and SFT per-product columns are genuine; the **SFT+GRPO per-product column and the entire CM table are FABRICATED**. The CM rows are physically impossible (per-product TP+TN+FP+FN exceeds that product's sample size for 11/15 products) and sum to TP1150/TN382/FP29/FN272 ≠ the genuine Total TP971/TN383/FP61/FN255. Only the column Average (82.73) and CM Total are genuine. Correct per-product GRPO BA (run-2 ckpt-530 DS): cable 68.16, pill 75.45, toothbrush 83.33, screw 72.89, transistor 75.42, grid 94.74, leather 98.44, zipper 68.84, capsule 69.78, hazelnut 88.57, bottle 76.27, carpet 95.51, wood 97.50, tile 89.83, metal_nut 87.47.

FABRICATED. | per-product recompute. | unverified |
| Per-product CM counts in tab:perprod-cm are genuine. | tab:perprod-cm L51–65 | 11/15 product rows exceed that product's sample size (metal_nut 130>92, grid 105>76); rows sum 1150/382/29/272 ≠ genuine 971/383/61/255. FABRICATED. | per-product sample sizes from JSON metrics; row-sum check. | unverified |
| Genuine SFT+GRPO ckpt-530 DS BA = 82.73, CM TP971/TN383/FP61/FN255. | Average L34, Total L67 | metrics block; BA recompute. | [`results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/checkpoint-530/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/grpo_qwen25vl_7b_6k_frozen_ep3_full_run2/checkpoint-530/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json); [`results/eval_ba_inventory.txt`](results/eval_ba_inventory.txt) | supported |
| Fabricated SFT+GRPO cells were chosen so their 15-product mean = genuine 82.73. | Average L34 | Mean of printed cells = 82.7333 → 82.73, the real overall BA, though cells don't match per-product data → back-filled to the headline average. | arithmetic. | supported |
| Base per-product BA column is genuine. | tab:perprod-full L18–34 | Recompute from [`results/qwen25vl_baseline_eval/`](results/qwen25vl_baseline_eval/): all 15 match within ~0.1–0.5 (printed truncated). | per-product recompute. | supported |
| SFT per-product BA column (ckpt-564) is genuine. | tab:perprod-full L18–34 | Recompute from [`results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json`](results/sft_qwen25vl_7b_zeroshot_6k_frozen/checkpoint-564/eval_dsmvtec_full_trainprompt.json): match ~0.02–0.20. | per-product recompute. | supported |
| Delta SFT / Delta GRPO columns internally consistent with adjacent BA columns. | tab:perprod-full L18–34 | All 30 delta cells = adjacent differences (<0.011). But Delta GRPO inherits the fabricated GRPO column → not the true per-product gains. | arithmetic check. | partially-supported |
| Per-product subdivisions sum to a different total "due to MMAD per-product test-set design". | footnote L72 | Misleading: genuine per-product CMs DO sum exactly to 971/383/61/255. The discrepancy comes from FABRICATED rows, not test-set design. | genuine recompute sums exactly. | unverified |
| Chapter (Results) image-level metrics are authoritative. | footnote L72 | Defers to Ch.06; genuine 82.73 is authoritative, this table body is unreliable. | cross-ref Ch.06; [`results/eval_ba_inventory.txt`](results/eval_ba_inventory.txt) | supported |
| GRPO adds gains for most products (positive Delta GRPO for all 15). | tab:perprod-full Delta GRPO | With genuine GRPO BA, GRPO REGRESSES several products vs genuine SFT (bottle 80.48→76.27, transistor 80.42→75.42) while improving others (hazelnut 66.61→88.57). Uniformly-positive column is a fabrication artefact. | genuine SFT 564 vs GRPO 530 per-product recompute. | unverified |
